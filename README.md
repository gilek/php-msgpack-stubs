# PHP msgpack stubs

This package provides stubs for [msgpack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-php) PHP extension.

[MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) is a binary-based efficient object serialization library.
It enables to exchange structured objects between many languages like JSON.
But unlike JSON, it is very fast and small.
